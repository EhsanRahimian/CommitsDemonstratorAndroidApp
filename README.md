# Commits Demonstrator Android App
This Android App fetchs the commits API in GitHub and demonstrats some objects in a list.
This app connected to the GitHub API. (https://api.github.com/repos/EhsanRahimian/CommitsDemonstratorAndroidApp/commits).
For each commit I demonstrate Commit hash, Author name and Commit message.
This app is written by Java and I used:
'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1',
"androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0".
More information: 
-minSdkVersion 21,
-compileSdkVersion 30.
Note: To test this app be sure you are connected to the internet.
