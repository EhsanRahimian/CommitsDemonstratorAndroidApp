# Commits Demonstrator Android App
This Android App fetchs the commits API in GitHub and demonstrats some objects in a list.
This app connected to the GitHub API. (https://api.github.com/repos/EhsanRahimian/CommitsDemonstratorAndroidApp/commits).
For each commit I demonstrate Commit hash, Author name and Commit message.
the task is to show the last 25 recent commits,but if the number of commit are less than 25, the app shows the exact number if the number is more than 25, the app shows only 25 commits.
This app is written by Java and I used:
'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1',
"androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0".
More information: 
-minSdkVersion 21,
-compileSdkVersion 30.
Note: To test this app be sure you are connected to the internet.
